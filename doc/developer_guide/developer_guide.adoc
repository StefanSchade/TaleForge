= Developer Guide

Welcome to the developer guide for our project. This guide serves as a comprehensive resource for developers working on this project, outlining best practices, coding standards, and our approach to software development and testing.

== Introduction

This project aims to deliver high-quality software that meets the needs of our users while maintaining a codebase that is clean, maintainable, and adaptable to change. Our development practices are designed to support this goal, emphasizing testing, continuous integration, and clear documentation.

== Getting Started

=== Setting Up Your Development Environment

// TODO: Instructions for setting up the development environment, including required tools, software, and any initial configuration steps.

=== Building and Running the Project

// TODO: Steps to build and run the project locally, including any necessary commands and expected output.

== Coding Standards

// TODO: Outline the coding standards and conventions used in this project. This could include language-specific conventions, naming conventions, and code formatting guidelines.

== Testing Strategy

Our testing strategy is designed to ensure that our software is reliable, behaves as expected, and remains resilient against future changes. We adopt a layered approach to testing, reflecting the architecture of our application.

=== Domain Layer Testing

The domain layer encapsulates our core business logic, free from external dependencies. We leverage Rust's powerful type system and traits to write expressive and comprehensive unit tests for this layer.

* Use the Builder pattern for test data to simplify the setup of complex domain objects.
* Focus on behavior-driven development (BDD) principles, ensuring that tests reflect real-world use cases and business requirements.

=== Application Layer Testing

Application services, or use cases, orchestrate high-level business processes. Testing at this layer involves ensuring that these processes execute correctly, integrating various components of the system.

* Utilize in-memory repositories to test use cases in isolation from external data sources.
* Apply feature flags or conditional compilation to swap between in-memory and persistent repositories based on the testing context.

=== Adapter Layer Testing

Adapters connect our application with external systems and frameworks. Due to their dependency on external technologies, testing adapters requires careful isolation.

* Employ mocking and test doubles for external dependencies to test adapters in isolation.
* Structure code to depend on abstractions (traits), facilitating the substitution of mock implementations.

=== Integration and End-to-End Testing

While the primary focus is currently on unit and integration testing within the Rust codebase, comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests will be essential as the project evolves, especially to test interactions with the frontend and external APIs.

* Integration tests should cover critical paths through the application, ensuring that components work together as expected.
* End-to-end tests will be considered in future phases of the project, particularly after the integration of OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation.

== Continuous Integration and Deployment

// TODO: Describe the CI/CD pipeline, including how tests are integrated into the build process, any automated code quality checks, and the strategy for deploying releases.

== Contributing to the Project

// TODO: Provide guidelines for contributing to the project, including how to submit pull requests, the code review process, and any criteria for acceptance.

We hope this guide helps you contribute effectively to our project. Your feedback and suggestions for improving this guide are always welcome.

== OpenAPI Code Generation

=== Overview

In our project, we utilize OpenAPI Specifications (OAS) to define the interfaces of our RESTful APIs. This specification is not only a powerful tool for documenting the API but also serves as the single source of truth from which we generate code that forms the backbone of our server implementation.

The use of code generation offers several benefits:
* *Consistency Between Documentation and Code*: Ensures that our implementation is always synchronized with the API documentation.
* *Efficiency*: Reduces boilerplate coding, allowing developers to focus on implementing business logic.
* *Reduced Error Rate*: Minimizes human errors in API implementation, as changes to the API require changes in the specification, which in turn automatically propagates to the generated code.

=== Generating Code

Our backend is built with Rust, and we generate Rust server code from the OpenAPI specification. We use the `openapi-generator-cli`, a flexible command line tool that supports multiple languages and frameworks.

To generate the code, navigate to the root of the backend project and run:
[source,bash]
----
openapi-generator-cli generate -i path_to_your_openapi.yaml -g rust-server -o path_to_output_directory
----

This command will generate models, APIs, and server stubs based on the specifications defined in the `openapi.yaml` file.

=== Integrating Generated Code

The generated code should be treated as scaffolding on which the business logic can be built. To ensure the longevity and maintainability of our code:
* The generated code is placed in a specific directory (`src/generated`) that is excluded from source control via `.gitignore`.
* Custom business logic is added in separate modules that use the generated code but are not overwritten during re-generation.

It is crucial that any modification to the API is first made in the OpenAPI specification file and then re-generated. This ensures that the documentation, client, and server implementations remain in sync.

=== Regeneration Workflow

Due to the nature of our CI/CD pipeline, every merge into the `main` branch triggers a regeneration of the server code if there are changes in the `openapi.yaml` file. This ensures our API implementation is always up-to-date with the latest specification.

Developers are encouraged to regenerate the code locally as well during development if changes are made to the specification, to catch any potential integration issues early in the development cycle.

== Needs to be Edited

* I doubt we can completely avoid manual adaptions to the generated code so the whole concept might have to be changed
