= Rust Development Learnings

We encountered several issues during the development and testing of a Rust project. Here's a summary of the challenges and the solutions we applied:

* Compilation and Testing Warnings
** Unused imports and variables can clutter the code and should be removed or prefixed with an underscore to suppress warnings.
** For unused fields in structs that will be used later, apply `#[allow(dead_code)]` above the struct definition to suppress warnings.
** Use correct syntax for attributes in Rust, which is `#[attribute]`, not `[attribute]`.

* Mocking and Testing
** Implementing mocks for testing requires careful attention to the syntax and structure of the mocks.
** Ensure the mock's expected calls match the actual use in tests to avoid panic errors at runtime.
** Use the `mock!` macro correctly and update to the latest syntax if warnings about deprecation arise.

* Working with Traits and Dependency Injection
** For dynamic dispatch, use `Arc<dyn Trait>` to pass trait objects around. This approach is useful for dependency injection in tests.
** When defining traits for use as dependencies, make sure the methods are defined in a way that they can be easily mocked or replaced in tests.

* Error Handling
** For methods that return a `Result` type, ensure you handle the `Ok` and `Err` cases appropriately or use `let _ =` to explicitly ignore the result.
** Implementing the `PartialEq` trait for custom types allows for comparison in tests, which is essential for asserting conditions.

* Code Structure and Readability
** Applying `#[derive]` attributes like `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`, etc., to custom types enhances their usability and testability.
** Structuring code with readability and maintainability in mind helps in the long term, especially when it comes to expanding functionality or refactoring.

* General Rust Practices
** Leverage Rust's powerful type system and compiler checks to catch issues early in the development process.
** Regularly run `cargo build` and `cargo test` to ensure your code compiles and passes all tests, keeping an eye out for any warnings or errors to fix.

This journey highlighted the importance of good coding practices, proper error handling, and the benefits of Rust's type system and compiler in building reliable and maintainable software.
