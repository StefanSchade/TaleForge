= Handling Async Handlers in Actix-web with Rust

When developing asynchronous web applications with Actix-web in Rust, it's crucial to understand the interaction between Rust's ownership system, closure trait requirements (`Fn`, `FnMut`, `FnOnce`), and async handlers. This document explains the issue encountered when implementing an async handler that moves ownership of a use case and how it was resolved.

== The Problem

The initial implementation of the async handler attempted to directly move a use case instance (`MovePlayerUseCase`) into an async block. This approach resulted in a compilation error:

[source,plaintext]
----
error[E0525]: expected a closure that implements the `Fn` trait, but this closure only implements `FnOnce`
----

This error occurs because the closure created by the `move` keyword takes ownership of its environment, making it a `FnOnce`. However, Actix-web requires handlers to be `Fn`, meaning they might be called multiple times.

== Understanding `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce`

Rust closures can implement one or more of the traits `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce`, which correspond to how the closure captures variables from its environment:

- `FnOnce`: Can be called once. It takes ownership of captured variables.
- `FnMut`: Can be called multiple times and can mutate captured variables.
- `Fn`: Can be called multiple times without mutating captured variables.

Since Actix-web handlers could be invoked multiple times for different requests, they need to be `Fn`.

== The Solution: Using `Arc`

To resolve this, we use `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counting), a thread-safe reference-counting pointer. `Arc` allows multiple ownership of the same data, which is perfect for sharing data across async tasks in a web server environment.

Here's how we adjusted the code:

[source,rust]
----
use std::sync::Arc;
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, HttpResponse};
use crate::application::use_cases::move_player::{MovePlayer, MovePlayerUseCase};
use crate::port::dto::MovePlayerInput;

pub async fn start_server() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let move_player_use_case = Arc::new(MovePlayerUseCase {});

    HttpServer::new(move || {
        let move_player_use_case = move_player_use_case.clone();

        App::new()
            .service(
                web::resource("/move")
                    .route(web::post().to(move |input: web::Json<MovePlayerInput>| {
                        let use_case = move_player_use_case.clone();
                        async move {
                            let result = use_case.move_player(input.into_inner());
                            match result {
                                Ok(output) => HttpResponse::Ok().json(output),
                                Err(error) => HttpResponse::BadRequest().body(error),
                            }
                        }
                    })),
            )
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}
----

By wrapping `MovePlayerUseCase` with `Arc` and cloning it before moving it into the async block, we ensure that the closure is `Fn`, not `FnOnce`. This allows the Actix-web server to call the handler multiple times across different threads, sharing the use case instance safely.

== Conclusion

Understanding the nuances of Rust's closure traits and memory safety principles is crucial for developing efficient and correct asynchronous web applications. This solution demonstrates a practical application of `Arc` to share state across async tasks, adhering to Rust's strict ownership rules and Actix-web's requirements.
