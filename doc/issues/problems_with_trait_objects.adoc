The error you're seeing is related to object safety in Rust. For a trait to be used as a trait object (dyn Trait), it must be object safe. This means that Rust must be able to create a vtable (virtual method table) for dynamic dispatch of its methods at runtime. However, not all traits can be made into trait objects.

There are several rules for a trait to be object safe, but the most common ones are:

The trait does not have any methods with generic type parameters.
The trait does not have any static methods (associated functions that do not take self as a parameter).
The trait does not have any methods where Self is used in the parameters or return type in a way that cannot be made into a concrete type.
Your error suggests that the PassageRepository trait contains some methods that violate these object safety rules.

Looking at your PassageRepository trait, the likely culprit for the object safety issue is the find_by_start_and_end_id method. Rust does not allow traits with methods returning Self or taking Self as a parameter to be made into an object because the actual type represented by Self is not known at compile-time.

To resolve this, you have a couple of options:

Use a concrete type instead of dyn PassageRepository: If you only have one implementation of PassageRepository and do not need dynamic dispatch, you can use the concrete type directly instead of a trait object.

Refactor your trait to avoid the use of Self: If a method does not need to use Self in its signature or return type, adjust it to return or take a concrete type known at compile time.

Box the return type: If you have methods that need to return implementors of the trait, you can change them to return Box<dyn PassageRepository> or another trait object instead of Self.

Split the trait: If the trait has both object-safe and non-object-safe methods, consider splitting it into two traits. You can then use the object-safe trait for trait objects and the non-object-safe trait for cases where you can use a concrete type.

Remove the trait entirely: If you find that you don't need the flexibility of using different implementations of the repository, you might simplify your design by removing the trait and using a concrete implementation directly.

If you can provide the method signatures within your PassageRepository trait that are causing the issue, I can give you a more tailored solution to fix the object safety error.

User
this is the passage repo

pub trait PassageRepository: Send + Sync {
fn get_passage_by_id(&self, id: u64) -> Option<Passage>;
fn get_passages_for_location(&self, location_id: u64) -> Vec<Passage>;
// New method to find a passage by direction and current _location
fn find_passage_by_direction_and_location(&self, location_id: u64, direction: &str) -> Option<Passage>;
fn add_passage(&self, passage: Passage) -> Result<(), String>;
fn find_by_start_and_end_id(from_location_id: u64, to_location_id:u64) -> Option<Passage>;
}

can you see violations that prevent the cration of a vtable?

From the PassageRepository trait definition you've provided, the issue with object safety likely stems from the find_by_start_and_end_id method. Here's the problematic part:

rust
Copy code
fn find_by_start_and_end_id(from_location_id: u64, to_location_id: u64) -> Option<Passage>;
The method itself looks fine and should not violate Rust's rules for object safety. All parameters are concrete types, and the return type is an Option of a concrete Passage type, which is also acceptable for a trait object.

However, the signature as shown is missing the &self parameter, which is necessary for instance methods in a trait. If this is just a typo in the snippet you provided and the actual code includes &self, there might be another cause for the error. If it's not a typo and the actual code is missing &self, that would indeed prevent the trait from being made into an object because Rust would not be able to create a vtable for static methods.

If the actual code includes &self and you still see the error, ensure that the Passage type does not contain any generic parameters and is fully known to the compiler. Additionally, double-check that all other methods in the trait meet the requirements for object safety:

They should all operate on &self or &mut self.
They should not return Self or have generic parameters.
They should not use associated functions that are not methods (i.e., they don't receive self).
Assuming &self was accidentally omitted in the snippet, the corrected method signature should look like this:

rust
Copy code
fn find_by_start_and_end_id(&self, from_location_id: u64, to_location_id: u64) -> Option<Passage>;
If you have verified the method signatures and Passage is a concrete type without generics, and you are still encountering object safety errors, then there may be other issues at play, possibly elsewhere in the trait or in the way the trait is being used. Please double-check the entire trait and its usage, including where you attempt to create a trait object from it.

If everything seems in order and you're still getting an error, please provide the full context of where and how you're trying to use the PassageRepository as a trait object, and I can help diagnose the issue further.
