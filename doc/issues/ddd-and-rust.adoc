= Implementing DDD in Rust: Repositories and Shared Services

== Introduction
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) emphasizes the importance of a rich, expressive domain model and clear architectural boundaries. Implementing DDD in Rust offers unique advantages due to Rust's strong type system, ownership model, and trait system. This document focuses on two crucial aspects of applying DDD principles in Rust: defining repositories as traits and utilizing `Arc<dyn Trait>` for sharing services across the application.

== Repositories as Traits

Repositories play a critical role in DDD by abstracting the persistence mechanism away from the domain model. In Rust, defining repository interfaces as traits allows for a clean separation of concerns and flexibility in the implementation of persistence logic.

=== Why Use Traits for Repositories?

- *Abstraction*: Traits provide a way to define a set of methods that a repository must implement, without specifying how these methods are implemented. This abstraction allows the domain model to interact with the persistence layer through well-defined interfaces.
- *Swappable Implementations*: By defining repositories as traits, you can easily swap out different implementations (e.g., an in-memory repository for testing and a database-backed repository for production) without changing the domain logic.
- *Dependency Injection*: Traits can be used to inject dependencies into your domain services or application services, making your system more modular and testable.

=== Defining a Repository Trait

[source,rust]
----
trait LocationRepository {
    fn find_by_id(&self, id: i32) -> Option<Location>;
    fn save(&mut self, location: &Location);
}
----

== Shared Services Using `Arc<dyn Trait>`

In a multi-threaded application, such as a web server, shared services and repositories need to be accessed by multiple threads safely. Rust's `Arc<T>` type provides thread-safe reference counting, and when combined with trait objects (`dyn Trait`), it allows for sharing implementations of traits across threads.

=== Why Use `Arc<dyn Trait>`?

- *Thread Safety*: `Arc` provides thread-safe reference counting, making it safe to share instances across threads. This is essential for web applications and other multi-threaded contexts.
- *Dynamic Dispatch*: Using `dyn Trait` with `Arc` enables dynamic dispatch, allowing multiple concrete implementations of a trait to be used at runtime.
- *Flexibility*: This approach supports the dynamic selection of implementations, which can be particularly useful for loading configuration at runtime or for dependency injection.

=== Example: Sharing a Repository

[source,rust]
----
let location_repository: Arc<dyn LocationRepository> = Arc::new(InMemoryLocationRepository::new());
let service = SomeService::new(location_repository.clone());
----

== Conclusion

Utilizing traits for repositories and `Arc<dyn Trait>` for shared services are powerful patterns for implementing DDD in Rust. These approaches leverage Rust's type system and concurrency model to build flexible, modular, and scalable applications. By abstracting the persistence layer and enabling dynamic, thread-safe sharing of services, developers can focus on the domain logic, ensuring that the software closely aligns with the domain's complexities and requirements.
