= Implementing DDD in Rust: Repositories and Shared Services

== Introduction
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) emphasizes the importance of a rich, expressive domain model and clear architectural boundaries. Implementing DDD in Rust offers unique advantages due to Rust's strong type system, ownership model, and trait system. This document focuses on two crucial aspects of applying DDD principles in Rust: defining repositories as traits and utilizing `Arc<dyn Trait>` for sharing services across the application.

== Aggregates as modules




== Repositories as Traits

Repositories in DDD serve as abstractions over the storage mechanism for aggregates. In Rust, defining repositories as traits aligns well with this principle by providing a clear contract for data access without coupling the domain model to a specific storage implementation.

[source,rust]
----
trait LocationRepository {
    fn find_by_id(&self, id: i32) -> Option<Location>;
    // Other necessary methods...
}

trait PassageRepository {
    fn find_by_id(&self, id: i32) -> Option<Passage>;
    // Other necessary methods...
}
----

By defining repository interfaces as traits, we gain the flexibility to swap out implementations. This is particularly useful for testing, where mock implementations can be substituted to test domain logic in isolation from external systems like databases.

== Shared Services with `Arc<dyn Trait>`

In a multi-threaded application, like a web server, sharing service instances across threads safely is crucial. `Arc<dyn Trait>` is Rust's way of achieving this for services that implement traits.

[source,rust]
----
struct NavigationService {
    location_repository: Arc<dyn LocationRepository>,
    passage_repository: Arc<dyn PassageRepository>,
}

impl NavigationService {
    pub fn new(
        location_repository: Arc<dyn LocationRepository>,
        passage_repository: Arc<dyn PassageRepository>,
    ) -> Self {
        Self { location_repository, passage_repository }
    }

    // Example service method
    pub fn navigate(&self, from: i32, to: i32) -> Result<Path, NavigationError> {
        // Implementation...
    }
}
----

`Arc<dyn Trait>` enables shared ownership of a service instance with runtime polymorphism, allowing for dynamic dispatch to the trait's methods. This pattern is particularly useful for dependency injection and runtime configuration.

=== Decision: Injecting Repositories

Regarding whether to inject repositories into services at instantiation or pass them with each method call:

- *Instantiation-time Injection*: Simplifies method signatures by not requiring repositories as parameters for each call. It's well-suited when the service consistently uses the same set of repositories, emphasizing a clear dependency relationship.

- *Method-level Injection*: Provides flexibility to pass different repository implementations with each call. While it increases method signature complexity, it allows for greater flexibility, such as using different data sources for specific operations.

Instantiation-time injection is generally preferred for services within the domain layer that maintain a consistent relationship with their dependencies, aligning with the DDD principle of clear, stable interfaces. Method-level injection might be more applicable in boundary layers or scenarios requiring high flexibility.

In most cases, especially within the domain layer, instantiation-time injection (using `Arc<dyn Trait>`) is a practical choice for maintaining clear, concise method signatures and emphasizing the stable relationships between domain services and their dependencies.
