== Handling Player ID in the System Architecture

=== Context and Need
The system requires a mechanism to identify and manage player states effectively, at the moment the need arises for the navigation service.
This involves passing player-specific information through various layers of the application, from external inputs down to the domain layer.

=== Alternatives Considered

. *Direct Passing of player_id*: Simply pass the `player_id` through function parameters from the controllers down to the domain services.
* Pros: Straightforward implementation; minimal complexity.
* Cons: Can become cumbersome with increased parameters; does not scale well with added cross-cutting concerns.

. *Context Object*: Introduce a context-like structure at the boundary of the application to encapsulate `player_id` and potentially other metadata.
* Pros: Centralizes cross-cutting concerns; easily extensible for future needs; separates domain logic from external concerns.
* Cons: Introduces additional complexity; requires careful management to avoid coupling.

=== Decision
After considering the alternatives, the decision is to proceed with the *Context Object* approach for several reasons:

- It provides a scalable way to handle `player_id` and future cross-cutting concerns without polluting the domain logic.
- It maintains the separation of concerns, keeping the domain model focused on business logic.
- It offers a flexible foundation that can evolve as the application's requirements grow.

Avoid the following:

- The context should remain outside the domain and not polute it
- choose use cases as pivot point to change from context to domain objects

=== Implementation Strategy
1. Establish a repository for player states to abstract the storage mechanism from the domain logic.
2. Implement a context structure in incoming adapters to encapsulate the `player_id` and other operational data.
3. Modify the web controller to extract `player_id` from the HTTP header, package it into the context, and pass it to the domain layer.
4. Design use cases to serve as the coordinators between the external inputs and the domain services, utilizing the context for cross-cutting concerns.

=== Future Considerations
- Extend the context object to include additional authentication tokens or metadata as needed.
- Review and adapt the context and repository implementations to ensure they meet the evolving requirements of the application.

== Benefits of Introducing RequestContext

The introduction of a `RequestContext` structure brings several key benefits to the application architecture:

=== 1. Centralizes Cross-cutting Concerns

*What It Does*: Consolidates information relevant across different layers that doesn't belong to the domain model, such as user session data and localization settings.

*Benefit*: Reduces clutter in domain logic and service interfaces by avoiding passing these concerns through every call stack.

=== 2. Simplifies Method Signatures

*What It Does*: Allows methods across services and repositories to accept a single `RequestContext` instead of numerous parameters for operational details.

*Benefit*: Cleans up method signatures, making the code more readable and easier to understand. It also streamlines future modifications.

=== 3. Facilitates Security and Auditing

*What It Does*: Carries authentication and authorization details, enabling implementation of security checks and auditing throughout the application.

*Benefit*: Ensures consistent security modeling and makes it easier to manage access control and auditing.

=== 4. Improves Flexibility and Scalability

*What It Does*: Decouples cross-cutting data from business logic, enhancing flexibility in handling operational requirements changes.

*Benefit*: Makes the application more adaptable to changes, especially in how user identity and other operational concerns are managed.

=== 5. Enhances Testability

*What It Does*: Enables easy mocking or setup of `RequestContext` to simulate various operational states or user contexts in unit testing.

*Benefit*: Facilitates thorough testing of business logic under different scenarios without complex parameter management.

=== 6. Supports Future Extensions

*What It Does*: Allows new cross-cutting concerns to be added to the context without affecting existing functionality.

*Benefit*: Anticipates change, making the application more extensible and adaptable over time.

In conclusion, `RequestContext` serves as a crucial mechanism for handling cross-cutting concerns in a structured and maintainable manner, aligning with clean architecture principles and enhancing the software's quality and longevity.
