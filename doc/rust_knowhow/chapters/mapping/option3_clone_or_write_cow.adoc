== Clone on Write (`Cow`)

The Clone on Write (`Cow`) strategy provides a flexible approach that defers cloning until it becomes necessary. If the data is not modified, `Cow` borrows it from the source object. If modifications are needed, `Cow` clones the data on demand.

.Code Snippet
[source,rust]
----
use std::borrow::Cow;

pub fn domain_to_dto<'a>(domain: &'a DomainModel) -> DtoModel<'a> {
    DtoModel {
        data: Cow::Borrowed(&domain.data)
    }
}

.Pros
- Offers a dynamic balance between efficiency and flexibility.
- Avoids cloning when the data is not modified, optimizing performance.

.Cons
- Introduces slight runtime overhead due to dynamic cloning decisions.
- Adds complexity through explicit lifetime annotations and management.
