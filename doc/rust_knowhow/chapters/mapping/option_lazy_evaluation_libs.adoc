=== Lazy Evaluation Libraries for Complex Scenarios

For more complex mapping scenarios, where the decision to clone might depend on several factors or where cloning is particularly expensive, using a library like once_cell or lazy_static could provide a pattern for deferring this expense until it's clear that the data needs to be owned.

.Code Snippet
[source,rust]
----
use once_cell::sync::Lazy;

static LAZY_MAPPED_DATA: Lazy<DtoModel> = Lazy::new(|| {
    println!("Expensively cloning data for the DTO...");
    DtoModel {
        data: "expensively cloned data".into(),
    }
});

fn main() {
    // The data is only cloned when LAZY_MAPPED_DATA is first accessed.
    println!("Accessing mapped data: {}", LAZY_MAPPED_DATA.data);
}
----

.Pros
- performance benefits

.Cons
- adds to the complexity of the codebase
- might require documentation
- can make it less predictable when operations like cloning will occur impacting debugging or performance profiling
