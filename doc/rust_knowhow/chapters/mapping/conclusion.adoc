=== Conclusion

Choosing the right data mapping optimization strategy in Rust depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the immediate use case.

I presume that in most cases the code can be designed in such a way, that ownership transfer will work. It seems a sensible approach to start here and defer the use of more sophisticated strategies to a time when they are actually needed.
