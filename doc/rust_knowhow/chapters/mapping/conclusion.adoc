== Conclusion

Choosing the right data mapping optimization strategy in Rust depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the immediate use case.

I presume that in most cases the code can be designed in such a way,



Ownership Transfer is ideal for situations where the source object is no longer needed, whereas Borrowing suits cases where the source needs to be retained. `Cow` offers a compromise that optimizes for performance while maintaining flexibility. Consider your application's performance characteristics and data usage patterns to select the most appropriate approach.
