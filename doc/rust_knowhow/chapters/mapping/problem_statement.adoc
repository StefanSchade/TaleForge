=== The Problem

Transfering data from one context to the other is a common task in software development:

* *mapping* one representation into the other
* accessing data via *getters* from the "Outside"
* using data contained in another context (e.g. struct, collection) in a *method*

In Rust, efficient handling of ownership in these transfers is crucial due to the language's memory model. Simply cloning data to avoid dealing with this problem can can introduce performance overheads, particularly for larger or complex structures.

We explore various strategies to deal with that problems. Each has its advantages and trade-offs, depending on the specific use case and performance requirements.
