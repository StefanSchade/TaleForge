=== The Problem

Cloning data during mapping operations can introduce performance overheads, particularly for larger or complex structures. While Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety, naively cloning data without considering the necessity can lead to inefficient use of resources.

This document explores three approaches to optimize data mapping in Rust by minimizing unnecessary cloning:

- Ownership Transfer
- Borrowing
- Clone on Write (`Cow`)

Each strategy has its advantages and trade-offs, depending on the specific use case and performance requirements.
