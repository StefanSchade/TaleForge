=== Borrowing

The Borrowing strategy involves using references to the source data instead of transferring ownership. This method allows the original data to remain intact for further use, providing greater flexibility in how data is handled post-mapping. However, it's essential to note that borrowing, by itself, doesn't avoid cloning but offers a strategy for more controlled and conditional use of cloning.

.Code Snippet
[source,rust]
----
pub fn domain_to_dto(domain: &DomainModel, clone_needed: bool) -> DtoModel {
    // Clone conditionally, based on the clone_needed flag
    DtoModel { data: if clone_needed { domain.data.clone() } else { domain.data } }
}
----

Note: The above code snippet is illustrative and may not compile due to type mismatches or lifetime issues. The concept is to demonstrate conditional cloning based on runtime requirements.

.Pros
- *Flexibility*: Allows the source object to be reused or remain unchanged after mapping, providing options for how data is managed.
- *Controlled Cloning*: Enables conditional cloning based on specific logic or requirements, potentially reducing unnecessary cloning in scenarios where it's not needed.

.Cons
- *Complexity in Management*: Managing lifetimes and ensuring data validity can become more complex, particularly in scenarios requiring mutable access or where data lives across different contexts.
- *Potential for Cloning*: While borrowing can defer the decision on whether to clone, there are scenarios where cloning becomes inevitable if the target object requires ownership of the data.

==== Understanding Borrowing's Role

Borrowing's real advantage lies in the deferment and conditional application of cloning, allowing developers to make strategic decisions about when and if cloning is necessary based on the application's specific logic and requirements. This strategy is especially useful in read-only scenarios or when data is temporarily borrowed for operations like serialization, where taking ownership (and thus cloning) may not be required.

It's a strategy that emphasizes flexibility and strategic decision-making in the cloning process, offering potential performance optimizations in scenarios where unconditional cloning can be avoided. However, it necessitates careful design and understanding of Rust's ownership and lifetime rules to be effectively implemented without introducing errors or unnecessary complexity.
