== Converting Synchronous Traits to Asynchronous in Rust

=== Introduction

It is generally good practice to model the behaviour of your services by defining interfaces - therefore transitioning from synchronous to asynchronous Rust code involves adapting traits and their implementations to return futures.

Unfortunately support for asynchronous traits, or the ability to define async functions in traits, is not directly available in the standard library as of the latest stable Rust releases.

This document explores different methods to circumvent this limitation:

=== Methods of Asynchronous Conversion

Several strategies exist for adapting synchronous traits to asynchronous versions:

. *Async Trait*
. *Wrapper Types for Futures*
. *Boxed Pin Futures*
. *BoxFuture Alias*
. *Custom Alias*

Each approach has unique advantages and challenges.

=== Traditional methods to model async behaviour in Rust

. *message passing through channels*
. *using synchronous  methods that internally manage async computations*

=== Conclusion

Each method for converting synchronous trait methods to asynchronous forms offers different trade-offs in performance, complexity, and ease of use. Your specific application requirements will guide your choice of method.
