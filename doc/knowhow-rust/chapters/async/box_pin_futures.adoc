==== Boxed Pin Futures

Using `Box<Pin<dyn Future<Output = T>>>` directly in trait methods is a straightforward way to return futures.

===== Pros

* Simplifies the interface without additional traits or wrappers.
* Fairly easy to implement.

===== Cons

* Involves heap allocation.
* Dynamic dispatch introduces runtime overhead.

===== Example

Similar to the "Wrapper Types for Futures" example but typically without defining a specific future type in the trait.
