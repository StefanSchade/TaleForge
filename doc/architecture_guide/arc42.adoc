== Context and Scope
=== Business Context
* Define the business context, including the main actors and systems interacting with the application.

=== Technical Context
* Describe the technical environment in which the application operates, including external systems and interfaces.

== Solution Strategy
* Explain the high-level strategy that guides the solution architecture, touching on the chosen architectural styles, patterns (e.g., DDD, Hexagonal, Clean Architecture, Event-Driven), and technologies.

== Building Block View

=== Whitebox Overall System
* Provide a high-level overview of the system's structure, focusing on the major components and their responsibilities.

==== Level 2
* Detail the decomposition of the top-level components into their subcomponents, focusing on the second level of granularity.

==== Level 3
* Optionally, provide further decomposition of components if necessary.

== Runtime View
* Describe how the major building blocks interact at runtime, focusing on key scenarios or use cases.

== Deployment View
* Illustrate the deployment architecture, showing how the software components are mapped to hardware or cloud resources.

== Cross-cutting Concepts
* Cover cross-cutting architectural concerns and concepts, such as security, data management, error handling, etc.

== Architectural Decisions
* Document key architectural decisions made during the design process, including alternatives considered and rationales for the chosen options.

== Quality Requirements
* Outline the key quality attributes of the system, such as reliability, scalability, maintainability, etc., and how the architecture addresses them.

== Risks and Technical Debt
* Identify any known risks and areas of technical debt that might impact the architecture or project.

== Glossary
* Provide definitions for key terms and concepts used throughout the documentation.
