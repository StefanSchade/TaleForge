== Abstract

=== Objective

This document describes the TaleForge architecture.

=== Audience

It is not exclusively aimed at (potential) contributors and users of the system, but also to learners either interested in setting up a Rust Web-App in hexagonal architecture or in the use of generative AI for developing similar applications (compare the project objectives described in the https://github.com/StefanSchade/TaleForge/blob/master/README.md[README.md])

=== Scope

The application is currently under development, but eventually it will likely consist of the following components:

* Backend in Rust
* Frontend in ReactJS
* Third party components
  ** Database
  ** Authorization Server
  ** Cache / Messaging
* Infrastructure and Deployment
  ** Scripts for deployment
  ** Configuration

This document will focus with both the back- and frontend as they are the assets, developed in this repo.

=== Document structure

The document follows the https://arc42.org/[Arc 42 Standard]

== Introduction and Goals

There are 3 Goals I pursue with this project

* Develop a plattform that allows users...
  ** to design their own adventure games and share them with others
  ** play

=== Requirements Overview
* Briefly describe the main business and technical requirements that influence the project.

=== Architecture Goals
* Outline the primary goals of the architecture, such as flexibility, scalability, performance, etc.

== Constraints
* List any technical, organizational, or operational constraints affecting the architecture.

== Context and Scope
=== Business Context
* Define the business context, including the main actors and systems interacting with the application.

=== Technical Context
* Describe the technical environment in which the application operates, including external systems and interfaces.

== Solution Strategy
* Explain the high-level strategy that guides the solution architecture, touching on the chosen architectural styles, patterns (e.g., DDD, Hexagonal, Clean Architecture, Event-Driven), and technologies.

== Building Block View

=== Whitebox Overall System
* Provide a high-level overview of the system's structure, focusing on the major components and their responsibilities.

==== Level 2
* Detail the decomposition of the top-level components into their subcomponents, focusing on the second level of granularity.

==== Level 3
* Optionally, provide further decomposition of components if necessary.

== Runtime View
* Describe how the major building blocks interact at runtime, focusing on key scenarios or use cases.

== Deployment View
* Illustrate the deployment architecture, showing how the software components are mapped to hardware or cloud resources.

== Cross-cutting Concepts
* Cover cross-cutting architectural concerns and concepts, such as security, data management, error handling, etc.

== Architectural Decisions
* Document key architectural decisions made during the design process, including alternatives considered and rationales for the chosen options.

== Quality Requirements
* Outline the key quality attributes of the system, such as reliability, scalability, maintainability, etc., and how the architecture addresses them.

== Risks and Technical Debt
* Identify any known risks and areas of technical debt that might impact the architecture or project.

== Glossary
* Provide definitions for key terms and concepts used throughout the documentation.
