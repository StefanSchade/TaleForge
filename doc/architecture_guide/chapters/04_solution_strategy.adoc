== Solution Strategy

The solution strategy for the TaleForge project is driven by the need to create a robust, flexible, and user-friendly platform for designing and playing graphic/text adventure games. This section outlines the technological choices and architectural patterns selected to meet the project's requirements.

=== Choice of Technology

The technology stack for TaleForge is carefully chosen to leverage modern, efficient tools that enhance development productivity and product performance.

==== Frontend

The frontend is developed using ReactJS and TypeScript, providing a strong foundation for building a dynamic and responsive user interface. Redux is used for state management, ensuring predictable state updates and facilitating easier debugging.

*Technologies*:

- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, chosen for its component-based architecture, which enables modular and reusable UI components.

- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

- Redux: A state management library that works well with React, providing a centralized way to manage state across the application.

*Development Tools*:

(Tools like Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and others that are commonly used in ReactJS projects would be listed here.)

==== Backend

The backend employs Rust with the Actix-web framework, prioritizing performance and safety. Rust’s ownership model and Actix-web’s asynchronous capabilities offer high concurrency and efficient resource use, making them ideal for the backend services of TaleForge.

*Technologies*:

- Rust: Chosen for its performance, reliability, and superior memory safety features.

- Actix-web: A powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust.

==== Integration

The integration strategy focuses on ensuring seamless communication between the frontend, backend, and external systems such as databases, authentication servers, and message brokers.

*Integration Points*:

- OIDC Authorization with Keycloak: For secure user authentication and authorization.

- Message brokers for asynchronous communication and event-driven architectures, enhancing system scalability and decoupling service dependencies.

=== Solution Architecture

The architectural design of TaleForge is predicated on several key requirements:

- *Flexibility and Scalability*: The architecture is designed to easily accommodate new features and technologies without significant rework.
- *Maintainability*: Clear separation of concerns across the system’s components makes the platform easier to understand, debug, and extend.
- *Testability*: Independent testing of each architectural layer ensures the system's robustness and reliability.
- *Collaboration*: Defined boundaries and interfaces between components enhance team collaboration and efficiency.

==== Architectural Patterns

To achieve these requirements, TaleForge adopts several architectural patterns:

===== Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

DDD emphasizes close alignment between the software design and business domain, facilitating collaborative development and evolutionary design of domain models.

===== Hexagonal Architecture

Also known as Ports and Adapters, this pattern decouples the application's core logic from external interfaces and frameworks, promoting flexibility and portability.

===== Clean Architecture

This architecture stresses the importance of separating concerns, resulting in a system that is independent of UI, databases, and external frameworks, and hence more testable and maintainable. It is closely related to hexagonal architecture and was proposed by Robert C. Martin.

===== Event-Driven Architecture

Event-Driven Architecture allows for high levels of decoupling, scalability, and responsiveness, making it suitable for complex, dynamic systems.

*Note:* While not currently implemented, we consider Event-Driven Architecture a viable option for future scalability and flexibility enhancements.

=== Conclusion

By adhering to these architectural principles and patterns, TaleForge aims to create a durable, scalable, and maintainable platform that supports creative game design and engaging player experiences.

The chosen architectural approach offers several advantages:

- *Flexibility and Scalability:* Easy adaptation to new requirements or technologies without impacting the core domain logic.
- *Maintainability:* Separation of concerns makes the system easier to understand, debug, and extend.
- *Testability:* Each layer can be independently tested, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- *Collaboration:* Clear boundaries and abstractions facilitate better communication and collaboration between team members with different expertise.
