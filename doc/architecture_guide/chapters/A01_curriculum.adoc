|*Domain Driven Design Distilled (Vaughn Vernon, 2016)*

This concise title is a great place to start. It presents the basic concepts of Domain Driven Design and shows how business analysis can be performed with DDD techniques.

However, the necessary detail to perform the concrete implementation in Hexagonal Architecture is beyond the scope of this book.

|*Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture (Tom Hombergs, 2019 / 2023)*

This title is very short and to the point and presents Hexagonal Architecture in an implementation orientated manner. Code examples are in **Java / Spring**. The more subtle details are beyond the scope of this book, however.

|*Hands-On Domain-Driven Design with .NET Core (Alexey Zimarev,
2019)*

This book excels where Homberg's book lacks. There is a detailed description of the business analysis parts (e.g. event storming) and CQRS - both are topics that were not covered by Homberg. As the title relates, the code examples are in **.NET**

Alexey Zimarev puts a strong emphasis on asynchronous architecture.

|*Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software (Eric Evans, Pearson Education 2003)*

This is a real classic and often just referred to as the "blue book". Definitely worth reading when looking to understand the fundamental principles of Domain-Driven Design, but due to its age not all that useful for implementation. It was published before the advent of hexagonal architecture.

|*Domain-Driven Design: Reference (Eric Evans, Pearson Education 2015)*

This reference gives a quick and authoritative summary of the key concepts of DDD. Availiable under Creative Commons Licence as a https://domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DDD-Reference-version-2015-03.pdf[free pdf]

|*Implementing Domain-Driven Design  (Vaughn Vernon, 2013)*

A classic for the implementation of Domain-Driven Design and often referred to simply as the "red book". Features cool cowboy illustrations. Code examples in **Java**.

Vaughn Vernon is a very prominent member of the DDD comunity and puts a strong emphasis on asynchronous architecture.

| image::./images/BookCover_MillettTune_PatternsPrinciples.jpg[align="center",width=150]
|*Patterns, Principles, and Practices of Domain-Driven Design (Scott Millett, Nick Tune, 2015)*

A more recent book that seems to be similar to Vernon's "red book". Code examples are in **.NET**.

| **Blog:** .Net Junkie on CQRS
|

Two articles of Steven van Deursen's blog https://blogs.cuttingedge.it/steven/[.NET Junkie] from 2011 featured the https://blogs.cuttingedge.it/steven/posts/2011/meanwhile-on-the-query-side-of-my-architecture/[command] and the https://blogs.cuttingedge.it/steven/posts/2011/meanwhile-on-the-query-side-of-my-architecture/[query] side of the Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) principle.

These blogs were an inspiration for the implementation of our domain stories and domain events.

| **Blog:** Vernon on Aggregates
| A series of articles by Vaughn Vernon on https://www.dddcommunity.org/library/vernon_2011/[aggregate design] with important considerations on persistence.
