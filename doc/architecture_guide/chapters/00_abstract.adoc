== Abstract

This document follows the structure suggested by https://arc42.org/overview[Arc42]. All sections originating from this template are numbered with the respective number from the template. Additional sections are unnumbered.

=== Objectives

This document will guide through the TaleForge development journey:

* describe *architectural patterns* and the intention behind them
* document *decisions* and the reasoning leading up to them
* communicate the established *design principles* to contributors and learners

Thus it will help facilitating efficient and coherent development practices both for TaleForge and for follow-up projects.

=== Scope

Given its ambitious scope, TaleForge (see https://github.com/StefanSchade/TaleForge/blob/master/README.md[README]) represents a large and complex project. Domain Driven Design (DDD) makes this kind of problem manageable by dividing it into subdomains, describing each as its own system.

This document describes the Subdomain "Game Execution" that is committed to facilitating a text adventure game that has been previously designed by one user and selected by another.

=== Intended Audience

* contributors (potential and actual) to the project.
* Development teams using this as a template:
    ** other bounded contexts within the TaleForge project
    ** projects with a similar stack but different functionality
    ** Large Language Models (LMMs), to communicate a desired structure of to-be-generated code
* Learners interested in the solutions / best practices we developed.

=== Future Considerations

* The assembly of the overall system will be described in a distinct document in due time.
* As this is the first bounded context we explore, this document will also be a template for future bounded contexts.
