= Introduction and Goals
:sectnums!:

The TaleForge project is embarked upon with two principal objectives:

. To establish a versatile platform that:
** Empowers users to design, share, and play their own adventure games.
** Facilitates the enjoyment of text adventure games, enriched with graphical elements, created by the community.

. To disseminate know-how and provide a replicable template for:
** Crafting an archetype of a modern, high-performance Rust web application with minimal resource demands, encompassing both front-end and back-end development.
** Enabling efficient and consistent development of additional applications within the TaleForge ecosystem and beyond, serving as a foundational blueprint.
** Offering a contextually rich example to Large Language Models (LLMs), guiding AI-generated code towards expectations aligned with real-world application development.

Additionally, this endeavor seeks to:

* Enhance personal proficiency and understanding of Rust.
* Garner insights into the integration of AI in pair programming contexts and the broader learning journey.

== Requirements Overview

The aspirations of the TaleForge project are underpinned by a set of business and technical requirements:

=== Business Requirements:
* Deliver a browser-based application that provides an interactive platform for both playing and designing text-based adventure games, augmented with graphic illustrations.
* Support multiplayer gaming experiences.
* Incorporate social functionalities, allowing users to review, like, and interact with game content.

=== Technical Requirements:
* Adherence to the principles outlined in the link:https://12factor.net/[Twelve-Factor App] methodology, ensuring a robust, scalable, and maintainable cloud-native application.
* Integration of production-grade solutions, including OIDC for authorization, secured communications via HTTPS, comprehensive logging, and effective configuration management.

== Architecture Goals

The architectural vision for TaleForge is driven by the necessity for a system that is not only robust and scalable but also offers an engaging and productive development experience. The guiding principles and patterns for achieving these objectives include:

* Maintenance simplicity, ensuring that the system remains adaptable and straightforward to update or expand.
* A superior developer experience, characterized by clear documentation, well-defined processes, and supportive tooling.
* Scalability and cloud-native design, facilitating the platform's growth and evolution without compromising performance or reliability.

=== Adopted Patterns:
* Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to encapsulate complex business requirements in a modular and intuitive domain model.
* Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) for decoupling core logic from external interfaces, enhancing adaptability.
* Event-Driven Architecture and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) as optional patterns, offering avenues for further architectural evolution focused on system responsiveness and scalability.
