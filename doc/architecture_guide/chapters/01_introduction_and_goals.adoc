== Introduction and Goals

There are 2 main goals I pursue with this project

. Develop a platform, that ...
** ... allows users to design their own adventure games and share them.
** ... allows users play text adventure games developed by others.

. Provide know how and a template

    ** Archetypical Rust web application with the following features:
        *** an up-to-date modern web application
        *** high performance and small resource footprint
        *** front- and backend
    ** To be used to create further apps efficiently and consistently
        *** Further development within the TaleForge project
        *** Useful for followup projects with a different functionality
        *** Useful to provide context to a Large Language Model, communicating the expectation for AI-generated application code

Aditionally, I want to

    * improve my own Rust know how
    * collect experience using AI in pair programing and learning
