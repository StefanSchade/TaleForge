== Introduction and Goals

The TaleForge project pursues the following objectives:

. To establish a platform for designing and sharing adventure games without coding
** Users can design and publish their own adventure games.
** Users can play adventure games in single and multiplayer mode.
** With "Adventure Games", we

. To deduce a template for:
** Developing modern web applications with a Rust backend and a ReactJS frontend.
** Providing a contextual example to a large language model to communicate an architecture that should be imitated when developing applications with a different functional background, but a similar type.

. To fulfill educational goals
* Enhance personal proficiency and understanding of Rust.
* Assess Rusts production readiness and deduce best practices
* Experiment with AI as a programming tool.

=== Requirements Overview

The aspirations of the TaleForge project are underpinned by a set of business and technical requirements:

==== Business Requirements:
* Deliver a browser-based application that provides an interactive platform for both playing and designing text-based adventure games, augmented with graphic illustrations.
* Support multiplayer gaming experiences.
* Incorporate social functionalities, allowing users to review, like, and interact with game content.

==== Technical Requirements:
* Adherence to the principles outlined in the link:https://12factor.net/[Twelve-Factor App] methodology, ensuring a robust, scalable, and maintainable cloud-native application.
* Integration of production-grade solutions, including OIDC for authorization, secured communications via HTTPS, comprehensive logging, and effective configuration management.

=== Architecture Goals

The architectural vision for TaleForge is driven by the necessity for a system that is not only robust and scalable but also offers an engaging and productive development experience. The guiding principles and patterns for achieving these objectives include:

* Maintainability: ensuring that changes to the system (bug fixes or new features) remain easy as the code base grows
* Developer Experience: clear documentation, well-defined processes, and supportive tooling
* Scalability & Cloud-Native Design: maintain performance and reliability while the platform grows

==== Adopted Patterns:
* Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to encapsulate complex business requirements in a modular and intuitive domain model.
* Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) for decoupling core logic from external interfaces, enhancing adaptability.
* Clean architecture
* Event-Driven Architecture and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) as optional patterns, offering avenues for further architectural evolution focused on system responsiveness and scalability.
